{"question":"How do I transform a deeply ingrained, self‑sabotaging habit when willpower is already spent?","answer":"First, identify the minimal atomic version of that habit—something so small you can’t fail, even when exhausted. Then link it to an existing routine: after brewing your morning coffee, take one deliberate breath and commit to 30 seconds of reflection. This micro‑shift bypasses ego resistance and rewires neural pathways over time."}
{"question":"What’s the stoic approach to handling criticism that feels unfair and stings my pride?","answer":"Recognize that criticism is the other person’s perception, not a verdict on your worth.

That foresight turns potential pitfalls into stepping stones."}
